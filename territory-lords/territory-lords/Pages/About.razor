                I played the Civilization game from the 90's a lot growing up. I wanted to learn Blazor Server so I thought why not use it as a chance to learn and doing something crazy and fun.

            The first Civilization was probably the first computer game I really remember playing and understanding. Maybe Dune II, but still, this game is fantastic.

            The second Civilization wasn't my thing. The graphics turned me off and I don't remember really playing it at all. I'm sure it was a fantastic game still.

            The third Civilization, I was back in. This time I was in to the graphics, city view, and the game play was great. Also, hello space ship!

            The forth Civilization and it's expantions were where I spent my time and money. This was the first time in 3D and I loved it.

            The fifth Civilization brought us hexes. The game world had so much more color and life. It seemed like such a living world that I wanted to explore.

            The sixth Civilization brought city buildings out of the city to make building more a part of the game. I own every expansion. Doesn't mean I'm any good at this game though.
